<h1>Point Pencil</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>I love <a href="pencil-pile.jpg">pencils</a>. If you didn't know that than I apologize let me explain why. Actually... I don't exactly know why I started liking pencils. My leading theory is because when I was younger I used to like to draw and make comics in elementary school. In middle school, teachers would give me assignments that told me to draw something that represents me. I decided to draw a pencil to represent my love for drawing. Slowly over time I started to like pencils more than drawing itself. Now, I barely ever draw, but my love for pencils is still growing stronger than ever. I collect them, I'm knowledgeable about them, and I design around them...But that's enough about me. More about pencils.</p>
