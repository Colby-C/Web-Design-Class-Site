<p><a href="">I love pencils</a>. If you didn't know that then I apologize let me explain why. Actually... I don't exactly know why I started liking pencils. My leading theory is because when I was younger I used to like to draw and make comics in elementary school. In middle school, teachers would give me assignments that told me to draw something that represents me. I decided to draw a pencil to represent my love for drawing. Slowly over time I started to like pencils more than drawing itself. Now, I barely ever draw, but my love for pencils is still growing stronger than ever. I collect them, I'm knowledgeable about them, and I design around them...But that's enough about me. More about pencils.</p>

<h3>There are six parts of a pencil (From left to right):</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Plug</li>
    <li>Ferrale</li>
    <li>Barrel</li>
    <li>Lacquer (Outside Coating on Barrel)</li>
    <li>Collar</li>
    <li>Point</li>
</ol>
